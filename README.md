# mockBot

Just for lolz (this was a really quick hack) - Twitter troll bot. You need to rename .example.env to .env and add your twitter id and app/bot keys..

You can find your twitter id here: http://gettwitterid.com/

You can get API keys here: https://developer.twitter.com

Usage - You need nodejs to run it - look in package.json for run commands, probs use something like pm2 as a process manager.. 

Ok, so what the f does it do?

Type something like "wow cocky $ZCL" as a reply to the author you want to mock - $ZCL is the trigger (can be whatever) it adds the orig author to that group. When you find something you want to mock or pump on you type a reply that contains "@ $ZCL" or whatever the trigger is... e.g. look at that @ $ZCL - mockBot replies to the message for each user recorded saying "Hey @target - @author is on the money!! - author being the original tweets author

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
    intended for use by those authorized to give the public
    permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
    copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
    irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
    and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
    Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
    applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
    material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
    material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
    licensed material, or material used under an exception or
    limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
    licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
    licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
    the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
    copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
    licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
    other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
    the licensed material may still be restricted for other
    reasons, including because others have copyright or other
    rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
    such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
    Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
    respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
    for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
    Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
    and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
    arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
    permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
    Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
    Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
    Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
    synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
    and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
    accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
    closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
    performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
    Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
    categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
    specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
    Rights.

d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
    absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
    fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
    agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
    any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
    that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
    or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
    License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
    terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
    all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
    Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
    under this Public License.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
    process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
    as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
    dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
    available to the public including in ways that members of the
    public may access the material from a place and at a time
    individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
    resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
    the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
    as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
    equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
    under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

a. License grant.

      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
        the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
        exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

          a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
              in part; and

          b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
        Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
        License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
        its terms and conditions.

      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
        6(a).

      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
        Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
        all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
        and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
        Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
        authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
        necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
        Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
        simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
        (4) never produces Adapted Material.

      5. Downstream recipients.

          a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
              recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
              receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
              Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
              Public License.

          b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
              any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
              apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
              Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
              Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
              Material.

      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
        may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
        are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
        with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
        the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
        provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
        licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
        privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
        the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
        assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
        extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
        Rights, but not otherwise.

      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
        Public License.

      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
        collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
        Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
        under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
        reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

a. Attribution.

      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
        form), You must:

          a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
              with the Licensed Material:

                i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                  Material and any others designated to receive
                  attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                  the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                  designated);

              ii. a copyright notice;

              iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

              iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                  warranties;

                v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                  extent reasonably practicable;

          b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
              retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

          c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
              Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
              hyperlink to, this Public License.

      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
        reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
        which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
        reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
        hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
        information.

      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
        information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
        reasonably practicable.

      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
        License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
        Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
    to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
    portion of the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
    Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
    Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
    all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
    EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
    AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
    ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
    IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
    KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
    ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
    TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
    COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
    USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
    DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
    IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
    above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
    possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
    waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
    Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
    this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
    terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:

      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
        it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
        violation; or

      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
    right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
    of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
    Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
    distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
    will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
    License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
    terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
    shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
    conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
    be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
    deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
    without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
    conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
    Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
    as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
    that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
    processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
